# TokioZ Development Roadmap

## üéØ Current Status (v0.1.0-alpha)

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Project Structure**: Proper Zig package layout with build.zig
- **Core Architecture**: Runtime, task queue, reactor, timer wheel, channels, I/O abstractions
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Linux (epoll), macOS/BSD (kqueue), fallback (poll)
- **Type System**: Complete type definitions for all major components
- **Basic Functionality**: Simple runtime demonstration working
- **Documentation**: README, DOCS, and examples
- **Testing Framework**: Unit tests for core modules

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**
- **Async Integration**: Currently using placeholder implementations due to Zig 0.15 async limitations
- **Event Loop**: Core reactor loop exists but needs async frame integration
- **Task Scheduling**: Task queue structure exists but needs async execution

### ‚ùå **TODO**

### **Phase 4: Ecosystem & Integration**
**Target**: Real-world usage and ecosystem

#### 4.1 Package Management
- [ ] Publish to Zig package manager
- [ ] Semantic versioning
- [ ] API stability
- [ ] Documentation site

#### 4.2 Real-world Applications

## üöß Known Issues & Limitations

### **Current Blockers**
1. **Zig 0.15 Async**: Self-hosted compiler doesn't fully support async frames yet
2. **Suspend Points**: Need proper integration with reactor for async I/O
3. **Memory Management**: Frame allocation and cleanup needs work

### **Architecture Decisions**
1. **Single vs Multi-threaded**: Currently designed for single-threaded, will expand
2. **Memory Model**: Zero-copy where possible, controlled allocations
3. **API Design**: Tokio-inspired but Zig-idiomatic

### **Platform Support**
- ‚úÖ **Linux**: epoll backend implemented
- ‚úÖ **macOS/BSD**: kqueue backend implemented  
- ‚úÖ **Others**: poll fallback implemented
- ‚è≥ **Windows**: IOCP support planned
- ‚è≥ **WASI**: WebAssembly support planned

## üéØ Next Steps (Immediate)

### **Week 1-2: Async Foundation**
1. Research Zig 0.15 async frame APIs
2. Implement basic async/await functionality
3. Create minimal working echo server
4. Fix suspend/resume in reactor

### **Week 3-4: I/O Integration**
1. Complete TCP async operations
